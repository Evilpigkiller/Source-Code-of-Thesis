1. create a new folder named "data" and put your own files in it.
2. change "base path" in the file "run_tracker.m" and "show_video.m".
3. run the file "run_tracker.m" and choose your own file.

warning: 
your own files in the "data" folder must have the file "groundtruth_rect.txt", it records the "x, y, width, highth" of your own target in the image or there will be an error.
